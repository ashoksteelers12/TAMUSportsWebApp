## App Description  
Want up to date data visualizations, stats, and schedule results all in one location? This 
Web App provides those features for your Aggie football and basketball teams. The data is 
retrieved from a website with the help of a Python library to create the App using R.

## Technology
**Language(s):** R, Python <br>
**Framework(s):** Shiny <br>
**Application(s):** Jupyter Notebook <br>
**Python Libraries:** sportsreference, csv <br>

## Navigating Through App
To access either the basketball or football information/statistics, press either football or basketball. 
To access roster, schedule, or stats, click the button for it at the top after clicking the specified sport 
(basketball/football). 

Can change between both sports by clicking on the other, then one of the three top buttons based on what 
one wants to see. 

## What App Contains
**Roster Section:** Contains specified stats for each player on the roster. Scroll down to find the different 
stats in a drop-down menu to compare each player with. 

**Schedule Section:** Contains the most recent schedule for both teams. 

**Stats Section:** Contains a table of the important/main stats and plots them in a bar plot. 

## Warnings
The basketball roster contains stats from all seasons the player has played uptill the 
most current. In contrast, the football roster contains the stats of the most recent (in this case 2019) season.
This was how the Python sportsreference library gathered the information for each, which differed. But both is 
uptill or for the most recent season.

## Possible Upgrades in the Future
- Web scrape instead of relying on a Python library
- Add more data/stats and categories
- Add more sports
