# TAMUSportsWebApp

This App contains football and basketball information on Texas A&M University from their most recent season. To update to the next season, the python code must be run again to collect new data and refresh the webpage. As of now, the information on the web app is of the 2019 sports year. 

The data was collected through the sportsreference library in Python on Jupyter Notebook. The data was transferred into csv files. The csv files were read in R. The app was created using shiny, as well as the plots.
